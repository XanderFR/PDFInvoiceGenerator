# PDFInvoiceGenerator
A GUI app made with Python's Tkinter and FPDF libraries. The app allows the user to submit how much they want of 4 given medicines (referred to as Medicines A, B, C, and D) and their name. The app then takes the name and total cost of the medicines and prepares a PDF document containing the relevant information.
